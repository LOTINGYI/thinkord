# Thinkord
<!-- <img src="./app/asset/thinkord.png" width="600"> -->

Thinkord is an open source desktop application dedicated to helping people conveniently capture their thoughts.  

It was originally developed by 5 college students in National Central University, Taiwan. We believe capturing thoughts should not be that cumbersome, but simple and fast.  

Hope you find this application helpful. If you are interested in developing Thinkord with us, please follow this [contribution guideline](#contributing).
